          Bunch is a mix of contemporary fashion and timeless silhouettes. it’s
          for people who dare to stand out and be creative with their own unique
          expression yet also appreciate good basics and classic suiting. the
          concept is to challenge the expected by creating contrasts in design
          and styling, to inspire an individual look, no matter who you are.
          it’s a brand that hopes to give everyone the confidence to wear
          exactly whatever they feel like. normality doesn’t exist and
          imperfection is our perfection.
